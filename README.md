# Sort-Max-Heap

Practice for implementing a priority queue using a max-heap. Plus, two additional functions for sorting a heap and checking if a heap is sorted.

### Prerequisites

A development environment will be needed to test this project. [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) was used for the development of this project.

### Testing

Tests for this project can be seen through the console. Some lines which were commented out in the final version of this project have been uncommented to make presentation of the program more clear. 

Running this program tests each of MyHeap's member functions, the sorting function, and the function for checking if the heap is sorted.
